===========

Tell the world about your huckleberries.

Huckleberries are affection and comradeship to others. They are often small, insignificant, and overlooked. Many huckleberries build up to show a large impact over time.

In simplest terms, Huckleberry is an Employee Recongnition Website. Employees log on and send small messages of appreciation to each other. 

* Thanks for making a new pot of coffee
* The presentation you did today was excellent
* I love how you handled that situation

Managers can use the system to see who is accumulating lots of huckleberries. This software allows you to get a general idea of how the employees are engaging and recognizing each other and may even be considered during performance reviews.

In closing,

I'm your huckleberry.
